# Arduino_Core_STM32 with CMake: examples

This repo contains examples to illustrate how to build a skech with [the STM32 core using CMake](https://github.com/massonal/Arduino_Core_STM32).

You are encouraged to take the CMakeLists.txt found in the sketches as templates and reuse them in your own.

The examples are numbered, going from most basic to illustrating the most advanced features of the tool.
All the examples are built for an STM32 L433RCT6P (identified as "NUCLEO_L433RC_P").
Other STM32 boards may, of course, be used, provided they support the relevant features.

Documentation about the CMake framewok is available [here](https://github.com/stm32duino/wiki/wiki/CMake_presentation).
Documentation about CMake itself is available [there](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/index.html).

Feedback, questions and comments are welcome! Feel free to open an issue or a PR.
